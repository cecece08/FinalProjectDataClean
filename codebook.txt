shows infomation about the code which used to get data and clean it into required tidy dataset
*****************************
variables in code
*****************************
testdata : X_test.txt, test dataset
traindata : X_train.txt, train dataset
testlabel : y_test.txt, test labels
trainlabel : y_train.txt, train labels
alllabel : merge test and train labels
alldata : merge test and train dataset
features : get features' name
mean_index : the index number for features with key work "mean"
deviation_index: the index number for features with key work "deviation"
index : the index number for features with key work "mean" and "deviation" 
subindex : get index number for subset with "mean" and "deviation" related features
newset : new dataset only including "mean" and "deviation" related features
newfeatures : only including "mean" and "deviation" related features' name
activities : name of activities and their id in dataset
named_act : get id in the dataset and get its related activity name
activities : activities names correspond to each record in the dataset
testsub: test subjects
trainsub: train subjects
subject : all subjects
mean_sub : data for each time of observation with all required features, subjects and activities
mean_all : tidy dataset
******************
work flow
****************************
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
 1)read data from file including data set(***data) and activity label (***label)
 2)merge data set (train and test) together
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
 1)read name of variables and get required variables (mean and std)
 2)get new data set with only required variables (std and mean)
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
 1)read name of activities and rename the activities
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
 1)read data
 2)merge all together including subject and activity
 3)reshape into desired table
   for each subject and each activity, loop over to get all matched observation and get the average for all features, then write into table, and get the next one.
